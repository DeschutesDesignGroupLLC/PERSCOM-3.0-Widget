# Getting Started With The PERSCOM Widget

The PERSCOM widget provides seamless external integration of your PERSCOM.io data into any website or content management system. Using a simple HTML code block, the widget can render and return your data in an elegant and non-obtrusive manner. The widget allows for full integration into your website through CSS customization.

## Using The Widget

Place the following HTML code block on your website wherever you'd like the widget to display. Make sure to replace APIKEY and PERSCOMID with the appropriate values. Your API key will need to have the `access:widget` scope assigned to it.

    <!-- Place the code block where you would like the widget displayed on your website. !-->
    <!-- Replace APIKEY and PERSCOMID with your API key with the â€˜access:widget' scope and PERSCOM Account ID, respectively. !-->

    <link href="https://widget.perscom.io/widget.css" rel="stylesheet" />
	<script src="https://widget.perscom.io/widget.js"></script>
    <div id='perscom_roster' data-apikey='APIKEY' data-perscomid='PERSCOMID'></div>

## Example
